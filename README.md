# üñºÔ∏è Face Detection with OpenCV

A simple project for detecting faces in images using **OpenCV** with Python.  
This project specifically uses a photo of **Lionel Messi** as the input example.  
The program uses a pre-trained Haar Cascade model to recognize faces and draw bounding boxes around them.  
This project is a beginner-friendly example in the field of **Computer Vision**.

## üöÄ Features
- Detects faces in photos using OpenCV.
- Highlights detected faces with rectangles.
